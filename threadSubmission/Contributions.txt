All borrowed code that I used in my solution have in code citations. 
The main portion borrowed from would be an example implementation of how to use mutex which I used as the basis to allow for simple counter messages to be sent 
without messed up formatting. (Race condition) 

The original code was based from code provided by Dr.Freudenthall 
Furthermore, general code guidance was provided by tutorialspoint.

All ideas and implementation decisions were completely original and solely mine.
